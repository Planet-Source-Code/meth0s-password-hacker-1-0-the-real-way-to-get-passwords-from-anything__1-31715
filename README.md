## Password Hacker 1\.0 \-\(The real way to get passwords from anything\)


</div>

### Description

Get any kind of password (Dialup, web, icq, zone, msn, aim, irc, any passworded textbox becomes visibly readble!)

I have looked around on planet source code in my time and noticed alot of password revealers and such things. all very nice indeed but it gets evan better. with previous tools you could only see the password in a seperate box on there program and only after you moved your mouse over the password feild.. now. every password is visible in its original text box with just 1 click of a button and 1 second. download my code and vote for me.
